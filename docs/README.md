> ü§ñ **Mergeable** helps automate your team's GitHub workflow without a single line of code.

Some examples of what you can do:

- Ensure Pull Requests follow conventions and [prevent merging of Pull Requests](#pull-requests).
- [Notify author of failed guidelines](#issues) when opening an issue.
- Schedule [detection for obsolete (stale) issues and pull requests](#staleness) and notify author and collaborators.
- And [more](#configuration)

# Usage

1. [Install](https://github.com/apps/mergeable) the Mergeable GitHub App.
2. [Create](#configuration) your recipe(s). Here are some [examples](#examples).
3. Commit and push the recipes to your repository at `.github/mergeable.yml`

> ‚òù **NOTE:** You can also [deploy to your own server](deploy.md).

# Configuration

**Mergeable** is **highly** configurable.
Define your recipes by creating a `.github/mergeable.yml` file in your repository.

## Basics
The configuration consists of any number of recipes. Recipes are created by tying [events](#events) with a set of [validators](#validators) and [actions](#actions) together:

```yml
version: 2
mergeable:
  - when: {{event}}, {{event}} # can be one or more
    validate:
      # list of validators. Specify one or more.
      - do: {{validator}}
        {{option}}: # name of an option supported by the validator.
          {{sub-option}}: {{value}} # an option will have one or more sub-options.
    pass: # list of actions to be executed if all validation passes. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}   
    fail: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validation fails. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}            
    error: # list of actions to be executed when at least one validator throws an error. Specify one or more. Omit this tag if no actions are needed.
      - do: {{action}}      
```

Take a look at some [example recipes](#examples).

> ‚òù **NOTE:** Earlier versions used a [different set of convention](version1.md#configuration). It will be supported in the foreseeable future but will eventually be phased out.

## Events
Events are specified in the `when` tag like this:

```yml
- when: pull_request.opened
```

Multiple events for a recipe are declared comma delimited like this:

```yml
- when: pull_request.opened, issues.opened
```

Events supported for pull requests are as follows:
`pull_request.opened`, `pull_request.edited`, `pull_request_review.submitted`, `pull_request_review.edited`, `pull_request_review.dismissed`, `pull_request.labeled`, `pull_request.unlabeled`, `pull_request.milestoned`, `pull_request.demilestoned`, `pull_request.assigned`, `pull_request.unassigned`, `pull_request.synchronize`,

And for issues:
`issues.opened`, `issues.edited`, `issues.labeled`, `issues.unlabeled`, `issues.milestoned`, `issues.demilestoned`, `issues.assigned`, `issues.unassigned`, `issues.synchronize`

>  ‚òù **NOTE:** More details about events can be found on the [GitHub events page](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events).

For convenience, wildcards can be used: `pull_request.*`, `issues.*`, `pull_request_review.*`


> ‚òù **NOTE:**  Each `validator` and `action` declares it's own supported events. Read the [validator](#validators) and [action](#actions) sections to find out which events are supported respectively.

'schedule.repository'

```
 > ‚òù **NOTE:** This is a special use case. The schedule event runs on an interval. When used with `stale`, it will search for issues and/or pull request that are n days old. [See a full example &raquo;](#stale)

### title
```yml

- do: title
  no_empty:
     enabled: true # Cannot be empty when true. A bit redundant in this case since GitHub don't really allow it. :-)

  ends_with:
     match: 'A String' # or comma delimited list of strings
     message: 'Come message...'
     # all of the message sub-option is optional   
```

### Advanced Logic
Validators can be grouped together with `AND` and `OR` operators:

TODO: Show examples.

## Actions

Actions are listed for execution at the `pass`, `fail` and `error` tags for a recipe based on the results of the [validation](#validators).

### comment
Creates comments in issues and/or pull requests depending on the event specified in the `when` tag.

```yml
- do: comment
  payload:
    body: >
      Your very long comment can go here.
```

Supported events:
```js
'schedule.repository', 'pull_request.*', 'issues.*'

```
### checks

```yml
- do: checks,
  status: 'success' # Can be: success, failure, neutral, cancelled, timed_out, or action_required
  payload:
    title: 'Mergeable Run have been Completed!'
    summary: `All the validators have return 'pass'! \n Here are some stats of the run: \n {{validationCount}} validations were ran`
```

Supported events:
```js
'pull_request.*', 'pull_request_review.*'

```
## Examples

### Pull Requests

Validate pull requests for mergeability based on content and structure of your PR (title, labels, milestone, project, description, approvals, etc). Here are a few examples:

**Work In Progress**: Prevent accidental merging of Pull Requests that are work in progress by labeling it `WIP` or prefixing the title with the abbreviation.

<details><summary>üîñ See Recipe</summary>
  <p>

  ```yml
  version: 2
  mergeable:
    - when: pull_request.*
      validate:
        - do: title
          must_exclude:
            regex: ^\[WIP\]
        - do: label
          must_exclude:
            regex: 'wip'
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

**Description**: Ensure all Pull Requests have a description so that reviewers have context.

<details><summary>üîñ See Recipe</summary>
  <p>

  ```yml
  version: 2
  mergeable:
    - when: pull_request.*
      validate:
        - do: description
          no_empty:
            enabled: true
            message: Description matter and should not be empty. Provide detail with **what** was changed, **why** it was changed, and **how** it was changed.
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

**Dependent Files**: Certain files are related and you want to ensure that they are updated as part of the PR (i.e. if `package.json` is updated, so should `yarn.lock`)

<details><summary>üîñ See Recipe</summary>
  <p>

  ```yml
  version: 2
  mergeable:
    - when: pull_request.*
      validate:
        - do: dependent
          files: ['package.json', 'yarn.lock']
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

**Milestone**: Ensure that all Pull Requests have a milestone associated. Mergeable will also detect when you are [closing an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) that is associated with the specified milestone.

<details><summary>üîñ See Recipe</summary>
  <p>

  ```yml
  version: 2
  mergeable:
    - when: pull_request.*
      validate:
        - do: milestone
          must_include:
            regex: Release 1
  ```
  </p>
</details>

<!-- **Projects**: Ensure that all Pull Requests have a Project associated. Mergeable will also detect when you are [closing an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) that is associated with the specified project. Useful when you want to make sure all issues and pull requests merged are visible on a [project board](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/).
<details><summary>üîñ See Recipe</summary>
  <p>

  ```yml
  version: 2
  mergeable:
    - when: pull_request.*
      validate:
        - do: project
          must_include: MVP
  ```
  </p>
</details> -->
<br>

Read the [configuration options](#configuration) for more options.

### Issues
Automatically create a comment when a new issue is `openened` to remind the author when the title does not follow conventions or is missing a label.

<details><summary>üîñ See Recipe</summary>
  <p>

  ```yml
  version: 2
  mergeable:
    - when: issues.opened
      validate:
        - do: title
          begins_with:
            match: AUTH|SOCIAL|CORE
        - do: label
          must_include:
            regex: bug|enhancement
      fail:
        - do: comment
          payload:
            body: >
              The following problems were found with this issue:
                - Title must begin with `AUTH`, `SOCIAL` or `CORE`
                - The issue should either be labeled `bug` or `enhancement`
  ```
  </p>
</details>
<br>

Read the [configuration options](#configuration) for more options.

### Staleness

Detect issues and pull requests that are `n` days old (stale) and notify authors and collaborators by creating a comment.

<details><summary>üîñ See Recipe</summary>
  <p>

  ```yml
  version: 2
  mergeable:
    - when: schedule.repository
      validate:
        - do: stale
          days: 20
          type: pull_request, issues
      pass:
        - do: comment
          payload:
            body: This is old. Is it still relevant?
  ```
  </p>
</details>

# Roadmap

- Additional actions like `label` and `assign`
- Potentially, integration with external tools like pivotal tracker, slack and trello.
-  More likely [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) or [sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/).
- Able to prevent merging based on the size of pull request.
